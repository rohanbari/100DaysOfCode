[I](https://github.com/rohanbari) originally started my #100DaysOfCode challenge on 1st February 2021.
This is my personal repository where I archive my code and make it open-source to everyone.

The history and everything of my code during this journey are always stored under the `src` folder.

Till the 100th day of code:

  1. I will code for at least an hour.
  2. I will tweet my daily achievements with the `#100DaysOfCode` tag on Twitter.
  3. The hour will not be counted at work, reading tutorials, or going through examples.
