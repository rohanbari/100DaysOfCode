[I](https://github.com/rohanbari) originally initiated my #100DaysOfCode journey on 1st February 2021.
This is my personal repository where I archive my code and make it open-source to everyone.

The history and everything of my code during this journey is always stored under the `src` folder.

## My optimal coding environment

  - I have Linux Mint 20.1 installed in my machine.
  - For C programs, I use GCC (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0 with `-std=c99` flag.
  - For C++ programs, I use G++ (g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0) with `-std=c++14` flag.
  - I prefer Visual Studio Code to write the programs, sometimes Vim editor.

## Till the 100th day of code

  1. I will code for at least an hour.
  2. I will tweet about my daily achievements with the `#100DaysOfCode` hashtag on Twitter.
  3. The hour will not be counted at work, reading tutorials, or going through examples.
