I originally initiated my `#100DaysOfCode` journey on the 1st February of 2021.
This is my personal repository where I will store my code and make it available
to everyone.

The history and everything of my code during this journey is always kept under
the [`src`](https://github.com/rohanbari/100DaysOfCode/tree/master/src) folder.

## Coding environment

  **Operating System.** I have Linux Mint 20.2 x86\_64 installed in my machine.

  **Compilers.** To compile C programs, I prefer GCC (`9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04`)
  with `-std=c99` flag.
  For C++ programs, I use G++ (`9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04`) with `-std=c++17` flag.

  **Text Editors.** I prefer only Vim text-editor to write programs.

## Till the 100th day of code

  1. I will code for at least an hour.
  2. I will tweet about my daily achievements with the `#100DaysOfCode` hashtag on Twitter.
  3. The hour will not be counted at work, reading tutorials, or going through examples.
